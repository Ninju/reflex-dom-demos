# Reflex-DOM demos

A collection of small demos and examples of building basic wigets using [Reflex](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex) and [Reflex-DOM](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-dom).

[Reflex](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex) is a fully-deterministic, higher-order Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) interface and an engine that efficiently implements that interface.

[Reflex-DOM](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-dom) is a framework for building web applications in Haskell, based on [Reflex](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex).

## Running the demos

The build directories are currently included, so you can run the demos without needing to install or build anything.

Simply open the demo folder, and then `source.jsexe/index.html` in your browser.
